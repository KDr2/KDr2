* Introduction

CL-FastCGI is a generic version of [[file:sb-fastcgi.org][SB-FastCGI]], targeting to run on
mostly Common Lisp implementation. 

You can get it from https://github.com/KDr2/cl-fastcgi.

CL-FastCGI's API is exactly the same as [[file:sb-fastcgi.org][SB-FastCGI]]'s.

* Differences between  [[file:sb-fastcgi.org][SB-FastCGI]].

** SB-FastCGI
   - Supports SBCL only.
   - No third-party packages dependences.
   - Supports unix-domain-socket/inet-socket/stdin
   - Multithreaded fastcgi server.

** CL-FastCGI
   - Targeting to running on all Common Lisp implementation. And now 
     supports:
     - SBCL
     - CMUCL
     - CLISP
     - Clozure CL
     - LispWorks
     - ECL
   - Depends on *cffi* and *usocket*
   - Unix-domain-socket is unsupported.
   - Multithreaded fastcgi server is unsupported(You can run it in
     multi-processes mode). 

* Which to Use?

If you use SBCL, I recommend you select SB-FastCGI, and package
SB-FastCGI has a nickname =cl-fastcgi=, so you can change SB-FastCGI
to cl-fastcgi or change back easily, without code modifications.
