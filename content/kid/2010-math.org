My 5 years old kid, Josh, likes math pretty much, he always actively
askes me to teach him math knowledge from when he was three. So I
picked some topics I thought which are suitable for him as listed
below. It turns out he enjoys them very much, if your kid likes math
as well, this list may give you a roadmap for reference.

  - GCD (greatest common divisor), LCM (least common multiple)
  - Modulo
  - Decomposition of prime factors
  - Factorial
  - Law of commutation, Law of association, Law of distribution
  - Precedence and parenthesis

* Notes
- ~[D]~ means DONE, items with this indicator are well learned by my
  kid;
- ~[P]~ means PARTIALLY DONE, I have taught my kid about these items,
  he understands the concepts, but can't apply them well;
- ~[T]~ means TODO, I haven't taught my kid about the items marked
