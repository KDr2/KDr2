Hi, I'm KDr2(ZHUO Qingliang), a nostalgist in technology, a martinet
in behavior, a misanthrope in society, an ascetic in spirit, a logical
positivist in philosophy, a learner in lifetime.

I am searching for a better understanding of myself and my
surroundings. To achieve so, I dedicate my thoughts to epistemology,
cognitive science, computer science, and linguistics. I read, think,
practice, and write. I would like to write here about things I
learned, if I think they are worth to write. But getting such things
is hard to me, a person on the hard way. So please don't set any
expectation.
