Yesterday Josh made 6 force cubes from 6 regular 3x3 stikerless
cubes. The process was very interesting, so I decided to record it
here.

First, we prepared six regular 3x3 IDENTICAL STICKERLESS cubes:

Then we took them apart into many kinds of pieces: cores, center caps,
corners, edges.

#+CALL: image[:results value](path="2022/09/fc-corners-small.jpg", width=600, caption="Corners") :results raw

#+CALL: image[:results value](path="2022/09/fc-edges-small.jpg", width=600, caption="Edges") :results raw

Then, we sorted the center caps by color and put each group onto a
core respectively. After that we got this:

The next work was to sparate the corner pieces and edge pieces into
smaller parts:

#+CALL: image[:results value](path="2022/09/fc-separated-edges-small.jpg", width=600, caption="Separated Edges") :results raw

and reassemble them into single colored corner/edge pieces:

#+CALL: image[:results value](path="2022/09/fc-reassembled-edges-small.jpg", width=600, caption="Single Colored Edges") :results raw

At last, we assembled the force cubes:

And, Josh also got some other ideas, checkerboard cubes which can
never be scrambled and sandwich cubes:

That's pretty much it, by the way, Josh has a big collection of cubes
which is listed on [[https://joshinbrackets.com][his website]].
