{{{rex}}} is a deployment and configuration management tool, like
Ansible being. Here are its advantages from its official website:

- Uses ssh, no agent required
- Seamless integration, no conflicts
- Easy to use and to extend
- Easy to learn, itâ€˜s just plain Perl

What I love most is the last one, "just plain perl", which makes it
more flexible. If you hate stereotype configuration files like me, you
should try it.

But unfortunately, things I don't expect happen around it:

- Development is under a low activity;
- Offical website was down for a time(being up now);
- Modules repository(https://modules.rexify.org) is broken: [[https://github.com/RexOps/Rex/issues/1185][1185]],
  [[https://github.com/RexOps/Rex/issues/1201][1201]].

The break of the modules repository is really the worst one. It indeed
casts a damper to the usage: users could not install any extension
module by ~rexify --use~ before it is fixed. (There's a
working-around, please read on.)

With all these being seen, the consequential question comes out: Is
{{{rex}}} dying?

I hope not, and it is actually not.

Ferenc Erki, one of the {{{rex}}} maintainers, said [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rex-users/v5nTnGHeNms][on the mail list
of Rex-User]]:

... I personally don't consider rex as a dead project, despite the low
activity. I wish I could work on it more, but it proves to be hard to
find the quality time simply because life happens (in chronological
order: being knocked out of tech for a year due to burnout, changing
jobs, moving to a another city hundreds of kilometres away, getting
married, selling/renovating flats in another country).

In fact, I started to organize an open source contribution meetup
locally so I have some dedicated time to work on non-paid open source
stuff again (mostly rex) in a managed fashion. So at least once a
month I'm sitting down and going through open issues and pull
requests. Plus I committed a contribution guide earlier this year that
should make many workflows around the project smoother.

Maintaining all the surrounding additional stuff (website, CI, build
pipelines, repos, etc. + sister projects like repositorio and
rex-recipes + support over IRC/mailing list) are currently beyond
me. If anyone is interested in helping out, I'm happy to discuss ideas
and review code.

All help are welcome :)

So some guys are still fighting there and we will probably see its
resuscitation someday.

If you are, like me, using {{{rex}}} now, or are trying to use it,
here's a working-around for the modules installation, install from the
source:

#+begin_src sh
  $cd $PROJECT_HOME
  $ls
  Rexfile
  $mkdir lib -p
  $git clone https://github.com/RexOps/rex-recipes.git
  $git -C rex-recipes checkout 1.4  # ensure rex-recipes is on branch 1.4
  $ln -sf $PWD/rex-recipes/Rex/ lib/
  $ls
  lib  Rexfile  rex-recipes
#+end_src

After that, all the extension modules in rex-recipes are installed.
